## 🚀 About The Project

**Appointly** is a modern, full-stack SaaS solution designed to streamline appointment booking and business management for service providers (e.g.,consultants, beauty salons, medical clinics).

The system is built with a **backend-first approach**, prioritizing data integrity, security, and scalability. It utilizes **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** to decouple business logic from external frameworks, ensuring long-term maintainability.

> **⚠️ Note on Source Code:**
> This is a commercial project intended for market release. The source code is currently **private**. This repository serves as a technical showcase, outlining the architecture, technology stack, and features of the system.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

Appointly follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles within a Hexagonal Architecture structure.

* **Domain Layer:** Pure Java code containing business logic and entities (e.g., `Reservation`, `Employee`, `Schedule`). No framework dependencies.
* **Application Layer:** Use Cases and Services (e.g., `CreateReservationUseCase`) orchestrating the flow.
* **Infrastructure Layer:** Adapters for database (JPA Repositories), REST Controllers, and external services (Email, Notifications).




### Key Technical Achievements
* **Custom Mappers:** Robust DTO <-> Domain mapping strategies to prevent circular dependencies and StackOverflow errors.
* **Strict Validation:** Logic-heavy validation in the Domain layer ensuring no invalid state ever reaches the database (e.g., "zombie" reservations without services).
* **Concurrency Handling:** Mechanisms to prevent double-booking and schedule collisions.
* **Modular Frontend:** Optimized React components with dynamic translations and theme support (Dark/Light mode).
